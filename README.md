# Statistical Analysis of Football Player Performance

Statistical analysis of football player performance across major European leagues using multivariate statistical methods.

This project was developed as part of a master's degree in statistics and implemented in R using a Kaggle dataset.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this study was to investigate how age influences offensive player performance across different European leagues.

We analyzed how offensive performance varies according to several factors, including:

- Age
- League
- Nationality

The analysis focused on identifying the main variables driving player performance and comparing player profiles across leagues.

## Methods

The following statistical techniques were applied:

- Outlier detection and analysis
- Robust Principal Component Analysis (Robust PCA)
- ACOBI (robust multivariate method)
- Robust regression

## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains performance statistics for players in the top European football leagues.

## Report
